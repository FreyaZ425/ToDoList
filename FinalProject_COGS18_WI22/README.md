This project is a To-Do-List generator.
To use this generator, you first need to initiate a ToDoList class object.

The add_event method enables you to add a thing you need to do in your calender.
The delete_event method enables you to delete an event in your calender.
The change_event method enables you to update and event in your clender.
The plan method enables you to pull up everything you need to do on a specific day.
The shoe_my_schedule method simply display the current schedule with everything on your to-do-list.
