    "I think I challenged myself in using pandas to creating my classes, and I almost went through all of the pandas directories and get to know a few of its method very well (although I only used a few, I tried a lot of them when I'm wirinting the code). As a result of using pandas in my class, I encountered so many problems, and I have to google a lot of ways to debug because in class we didn't learn panda very deep. The mere act of importing the class into my notebook with the correct style of importing took me one day to figure out. I also spent a large amount of time refractoring my code. For example, I tried four or five ways to write the 'plan' method. I was trying to use if/else statement at first, and then I switched to for loop and while loop, and finally I realized methods in pandas might help me with this so I went with it. \n",
    "The process of creating this project has been extremetly challenging for me. Honestly saying, I spent at least 20 hours on this project and still can't get all of the parts to work, which I'm pretty upset about.\n",
    "I think this might not be the best project idea since I'm not so familiar with neither pandas nor Python itself. IHowever, I did not change it because I was already so commited to it and I do really want to challenge myself. I also realize toward the end that I don't know how to create a test file for class method because I don't have any functions for my project other than my class methods. In the end, I'm still not able to make the bytest to work, but I'm trying till the last minute to make it work. If there will be feedback on the project, I would love to know how to make the pytest work.\n",
    "I have to admit that I'm not the smartest when it comes to coding and a lot of learning doesn't happen naturally to me. Althought the results are not perfect, I believe that I tried my best. I Definitely learned a lot through making this final project and I do not regret it."
